# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

Waveline has been completely refactored to implement production-ready security practices. All authentication is now server-side with encrypted token storage.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Eliminated Hardcoded Secrets ✅
- All API keys and secrets moved to environment variables
- Created `.env.example` template for developers
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from codebase
- Updated documentation to reference environment variables only

### 2. Server-Side Authentication Flow ✅
- Tokens are never exposed to the client-side
- Secure HTTP-only cookies with JWT encryption
- Automatic token refresh without user intervention
- Server-side API proxy for all Spotify requests

### 3. Encrypted Token Storage ✅
- JWT-based token encryption using `jose` library
- Secure cookie configuration (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Automatic token expiration handling
- Secure token refresh mechanism

### 4. API Security ✅
- All Spotify API calls proxied through secure server routes
- Automatic authentication validation
- Error handling for expired/invalid tokens
- Rate limiting and request validation

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Spotify API Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id

# AI Integration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Security (CRITICAL - Change in production)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_for_production

# Optional: For production deployment
VERCEL_URL=your_vercel_deployment_url
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates OAuth with Spotify
2. Authorization code received on callback
3. Server exchanges code for tokens
4. Tokens encrypted and stored in HTTP-only cookie
5. Client never has access to raw tokens

### API Requests
1. Client makes request to `/api/spotify/[...path]`
2. Server validates encrypted cookie
3. Server makes authenticated request to Spotify
4. Response proxied back to client
5. Automatic token refresh if needed

### Token Management
- Tokens automatically refreshed before expiration
- Failed refresh triggers re-authentication
- Secure logout clears all stored tokens
- No token data in localStorage or client-side storage

## Deployment Security Checklist

- [ ] Generate strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (32+ characters)
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Confirm HTTPS is enabled in production
- [ ] Test token refresh functionality
- [ ] Validate cookie security settings
- [ ] Review CORS and CSP headers

## Security Monitoring

The application includes built-in security monitoring:
- Authentication status tracking
- Token expiration monitoring
- Failed request logging
- Automatic error recovery

## Vulnerability Prevention

### Prevented Issues:
- ✅ Client-side token exposure
- ✅ Hardcoded API credentials
- ✅ Token refresh failures
- ✅ CSRF attacks (via secure cookies)
- ✅ XSS token theft (HTTP-only cookies)
- ✅ Man-in-the-middle attacks (HTTPS enforcement)

### Browser Extension Conflicts:
- ✅ Ethereum property conflicts resolved
- ✅ Safe global object handling
- ✅ Non-intrusive conflict prevention

## Testing Security

To verify security implementation:

1. **Check Token Storage**: Inspect browser - no tokens in localStorage
2. **Verify Cookies**: Check HTTP-only cookie is set after auth
3. **Test Token Refresh**: Wait for token expiration, verify auto-refresh
4. **Validate Logout**: Confirm all tokens cleared on logout
5. **API Proxy**: Verify all Spotify calls go through `/api/spotify/`

## Emergency Procedures

If security breach suspected:
1. Immediately rotate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
2. Revoke Spotify app credentials
3. Clear all user sessions
4. Review server logs for suspicious activity
5. Update environment variables across all deployments
